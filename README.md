# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
Creates a Tensorflow model to recognize traffic signs. A Convolutional Neural Network is created in "main.py". 
This model is trained on pictures of traffic signs (GTSRB https://benchmark.ini.rub.de/gtsrb_news.html).
In "camera.py" a camera is set up to recognize traffic signs with the trained model.
